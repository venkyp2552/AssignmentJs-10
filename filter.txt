Yes:

Why:
In functional programming, filter is a higher-order function that processes a data structure (usually a list) in some order to 
produce a new data structure. containing exactly those elements of the original data structure for which a 
given predicate returns the boolean value true.

const data = ["hashnode", "is", undefined]

// We could filter out the undefined data by saying
const filteredData = data.filter((x) => x != undefined)

console.log(filteredData ) // ["hashnode", "is"]
